# Preface

This course came into being after postgraduate students request of training in programming skills.

I believe the best way to learn programming is via examples.

This is also a good writing project for me to develop some taste about constant writing.

## Prerequisite

For this course, please install [R](http://www.r-project.org/).
An fully functional integrated development environment is also highly desirable and
makes programming much more friendly and enjoyable.
[RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) is recommended.

## About Book Version

I write in Rmarkdown. It is very convenient and highly efficient. It makes an writer easier to develop a long writing project.

RStudio is of course helpful. However, in the period of writing I prefer a single-functional text editor like Atom, so that I don't need to worry about spellcheck.

Is this the moment I come back to write again? I am not sure. I will see how it develops.
